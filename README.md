# 🧠 Object Detection for Visually Impaired using Deep Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by using deep learning techniques for real-time object detection. The system identifies objects from live video input and provides audio feedback, helping users understand their surroundings and navigate safely.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an intelligent and user-friendly system that enhances independence and safety for visually impaired people through real-time object detection and voice assistance.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection  
- Audio feedback using Text-to-Speech  
- High accuracy using deep learning models  
- Easy to use interface  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Deep Learning (CNN, YOLO)  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. Capture video input through camera  
2. Preprocess the image frames  
3. Detect objects using trained deep learning model  
4. Convert detected objects into audio output  
5. Provide feedback to the user  

## 📊 Working
The system continuously captures frames from a camera and processes them using a trained object detection model. Once objects are detected, their names are converted into speech output, allowing visually impaired users to understand their environment.

## 📌 Applications
- Assistive technology for visually impaired  
- Smart navigation systems  
- Indoor and outdoor guidance  

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with mobile applications  
- GPS-based navigation support  
- Improved accuracy with advanced models
